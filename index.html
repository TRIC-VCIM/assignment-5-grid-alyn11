      <h1> Taylor Swift's Folklore </h1>
    	<p>October 24th, 2006 Taylor Swift released her first album, self titled Taylor Swift. Since then Taylor Swift has released 7 more albums. With the most recent album Folklore Swift described Folklore as an “entire brand-new album of songs I’ve poured all my whims, dreams, fears, and musings into…Before this year, I probably would’ve overthought when to release this music at the “perfect time” but the times we’re living in keep reminding me that nothing is guaranteed. My gut is telling me that if you make something you love, you should just put it into the world. That’s the side of uncertainty I can get on board with.”</p>
